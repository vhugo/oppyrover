# OppyRover
> This project is my very first game idea.

## The idea

A top-down map exploration puzzle about the mars rover, some of the ideas in this
project are stolen/inspired by [Duskers](http://duskers.misfits-attic.com/),
[NASA's rover game](https://www.nasa.gov/audience/foreducators/robotics/home/ROVER.html#.WmY3CfgbOAw)
and a simplistic explanation of [how rover drives on mars](https://youtu.be/e6vzjNkDB5k).

Running this project:

```
> python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
> python3 oppyrover.py
```
